Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician,
media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president
of the United States from 2017 to 2021.
Trump received a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University
of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father named him president of his real
estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and
reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers,
hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business failures
in the late 1990s, he launched successful side ventures, mostly
licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted
the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses
have been plaintiffs or defendants in more than 4,000 legal actions,
including six business bankruptcies.

In ancient times, the city was known as Onchesmus or Onchesmos
and was a port-town of Chaonia in ancient Epirus. It owes its
modern name to the nearby Byzantine monastery of the Forty Saints
(Agioi Saranda) by which it became known from the High Middle Ages.
Sarandë today is known for its deep blue waters of the Mediterranean.
Near Sarandë are the remains of the ancient city of Butrint, a
UNESCO World Heritage site. In recent years, Sarandë has seen a
steady increase in tourists, many of them coming by cruise ships.
Visitors are attracted by the natural environment of Sarandë and
its archaeological sites. Sarandë is inhabited by a majority of
ethnic Albanians, and also has a minority Greek community and as
such it has been considered one of the two centers of the Greek
minority in Albania.[1][2]
